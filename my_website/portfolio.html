	<h2>June 21 Showcase</h2>
		  <p> Today, we learned how to use MIT APP Inventor. Through many pains, aches and sorrows this app was finally created.
			  It is called <b>"Yap at Me"</b>. Might use this one in class!</p>

	<h2>June 22 Showcase</h2>
		  <p> We learned how to use Python. We created a story. It was a fantastic way to learn def and 'if' functions!
			  It is called <b>"LateNightFastFood"</b>. </p>

	<h2>June 26 Showcase</h2>
		  <p> This weekend I worked on revamping a game for the showcase Monday. I took an addition - subtraction game and made it into a
			  multiplication / division game. It was kind of tricky because initially it the game was having you divide 7/5 and multiply 
			  114 by 6 so I had to change parameters and add modulos. You can certainly learn a lot from doing this. I learned that %d and %s
			  are placeholders in Python for an integer or string.
			  It is called <b>"Flashcard"</b>. </p>

		  <p>Graphing, in a word, intriguing. Not as bad as I thought, lots of online code to manipulate.</p>
